# cuboids

Write code that represents 3D objects in space - to keep it real simple, only "rectangular cuboids." That way you could represent one by having an origin (z,y,x) and length, width, height. Of course, you should be able to create (initialize) an object at a certain origin, with a certain length/width/height. You should also be able to move your object to a different origin. Additionally, you should be able to get a list of the vertices that represent the cuboid (a total of 8 vertices).

Now here's the important part - write a method that tests whether or not 2 cuboids are overlapping.
